            <p>All kindsa blurbs. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Here's something that's fun. Let's get crazy. Steve wants         reflections, so let's give him reflections. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.
            </p><br>
            <p> I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.
