      <p>Up to 92% of inmates in American detention centers have years of experience in the workforce, and it is our belief at PrisonerSkills that letting that experience and expertise go to waste is an injustice not only to the inmates and employers we serve, but to the economic health of the country. Reformed individuals who seek earnest work meet employers who need skilled employees when they are listed in our convenient web service. It is our mission to see that every willing man and woman finds a career.</p>
      
      <p>Our services are entirely virtual-based, meaning we can be accessed anytime, from anywhere. We currently serve detention centers in 47 states, with contracted employees being hired in all 50.</p>
    
      <p>We work with over 800 facilities at present, and have provided nearly 20,000 qualified workers to more than 8,000 businesses. We pride ourselves in sourcing nearly 70% of our contracted workers to small-scale, independently-owned businesses of every industry imaginable. This selectiveness empowers the workers we employ to make meaningful connections, and to build professional relationships that have the capability to last a lifetime.</p>
